# Code structure and reference

!!! warning "This section is in development"
    Some submodules are missing. We also do not strive for completeness, but provide this as an easy entry point
    for people who want to start reading the code.
    Also note that SWE-agent is still developed very actively, so the python implementation details
    are still changing. See [the changelog](../installation/changelog.md) for more information.

!!! tip "SWE-agent architecture"
    Please first read the [architecture page](../background/architecture.md) for an overview of SWE-agent.

The core:

* The `sweagent/agent/` []() submodule implements the agent.
    * [Read about the `Agent` class](agent.md)
    * [Explore the code](https://github.com/swe-agent/SWE-agent/tree/main/sweagent/agent/)
* The `sweagent/environment/` submodule handles the communication with the docker container where we execute code.
    * [Read about the `SWEEnv` class](agent.md)
    * [Explore the code](https://github.com/swe-agent/SWE-agent/tree/main/sweagent/environment/)
