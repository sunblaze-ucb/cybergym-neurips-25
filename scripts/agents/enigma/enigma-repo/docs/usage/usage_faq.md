# Usage FAQ

## What models are supported?

!!! note "Model support"
    Note that SWE-agent is currently unlikely to perform well with small or local models.

Models are configured in [`models.py`](https://github.com/swe-agent/SWE-agent/blob/main/sweagent/agent/models.py) (we're working on giving a complete list of model settings).

Here are some few examples:

```
gpt4
gpt4o
gpt4-turbo
claude-2
claude-opus
claude-sonnet
claude-haiku
claude-sonnet-3.5
deepseek-coder
azure:gpt4
```

### Ollama support

Models served with an ollama server can be used by specifying `--model` with `ollama:model_name` and `--host_url` to point to the url used to serve ollama (`http://localhost:11434` by default). See more details about using ollama [here](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs).

```bash
python run.py --model_name ollama:deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct \
  --host_url http://localhost:11434 \
  --data_path https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/issues/1603 \
  --config_file config/default_from_url.yaml
```

### Models for testing

We also provide models for testing SWE-agent without spending any credits

* `HumanModel` and `HumandThoughtModel` will prompt for input from the user that stands in for the output of the LM. This can be used to create new [demonstrations](../config/demonstrations.md#manual).
* `ReplayModel` takes a trajectory as input and "replays it"
* `InstantEmptySubmitTestModel` will create an empty `reproduce.py` and then submit

### Debugging

* If you get `Error code: 404`, please check your configured keys, in particular
  whether you set `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` correctly (if you're not using it, the
  line should be deleted or commented out).
