# Usage

We currently provide two interfaces to SWE-agent:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-keyboard:{ .lg .middle } __Command line interface (CLI)__

    ---

    The default way of running SWE-agent with maximum options.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Get started](cl_tutorial.md)

-   :material-mouse:{ .lg .middle } __Graphical user interface__

    ---

    We provide a browser-based graphical user interface particularly optimized for developers wanting to use SWE-agent as a tool.

For EnIGMA usage, only the CLI is currently supported. [Get started here](enigma.md).
