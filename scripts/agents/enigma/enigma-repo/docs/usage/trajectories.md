# Trajectories

The [`trajectories/`](https://github.com/swe-agent/SWE-agent/tree/main/trajectories) folder is the default location that experiment results (invocations of [`run.py`](cl_tutorial.md)) will be written to.

```
</details>

At a high level, the experiments folder is organized in the following manner:
```
trajectories
├── <user 1> 👩‍💻
│ ├── <experiment 1> 🧪
│ │ ├── all_preds.jsonl
│ │ ├── args.yaml
│ │ ├── *.html (Webpage Files)
│ │ └── *.traj (Trajectories)
│ └── <experiment 2> 🧪
│   ├── all_preds.jsonl
│   ├── args.yaml
│   ├── *.html (Webpage Files)
│   └── *.traj (Trajectories)
├── <user 2> 👨‍💻
│ ├── <experiment 1> 🧪
│ │ └── ...
│ └── <experiment 2> 🧪
│   └── ...
...
```
Where every experiment follows the pattern `trajectories/<user name>/<experiment name>`. The `<user name>` is automatically inferred from your system, and the `experiment name` is inferred from the arguments of the `run.py`.

!!! tip "Viewing trajectories"
    We provide a [trajectory viewer](inspector.md) for an easy viewing of trajectories.

## How an Experiment Folder is Generated

Each call to `run.py` produces a single `trajectories/<user name>/<experiment name>` folder containing the following assets:

* `all_preds.jsonl`: A single file containing all of the predictions generated for the experiment (1 prediction per task instance), where each line is formatted as:
```
{
    "instance_id": "<Unique task instance ID>",
    "model_patch": "<.patch file content string>",
    "model_name_or_path": "<Model name here (Inferred from experiment configs)>",
}
```
* `args.yaml`: A summary of the configurations for the experiment run.
* `<instance_id>.traj`: A `.json` formatted file containing the (thought, action, observation) turns generated by SWE-agent towards solving `<instance_id>`.
* `<instance_id>.html`: An `.html` single webpage render of the trajectory, which can be directly opened in the browser for easier viewing of the trajectory.

!!! tip
    * Evaluation is not completed by `run.py`, it is a separate step (see [benchmarking](benchmarking.md))
    * `all_preds.jsonl` can be referenced directly into SWE-bench to run evaluation (see [benchmarking](benchmarking.md))
    * Trajectories can be turned into custom demonstrations for SWE-agent ([more information](../config/demonstrations.md)).
