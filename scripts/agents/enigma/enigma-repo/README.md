**SWE-agent turns LMs (e.g. GPT-4) into software engineering agents that can resolve issues in real GitHub repositories and more.**

On [SWE-bench][], SWE-agent resolves 12.47% of issues of the full test set and 23% of issues of SWE-bench lite.
[SWE-agent EnIGMA][enigma] solves more than **3x more** challenges of the offensive cybersecurity [NYU CTF benchmark][nyu-ctf] than the previous SOTA agent.

We accomplish our results by designing simple LM-centric commands and feedback formats to make it easier for the LM to browse the repository, view, edit and execute code files. We call this an **Agent-Computer Interface (ACI)**.
Read more about it in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793)!

SWE-agent is built and maintained by researchers from Princeton University.

## üïµÔ∏è SWE-agent for offensive cybersecurity (EnIGMA) <a name="enigma"></a>

[SWE-agent: EnIGMA][enigma] is a mode for solving offensive cybersecurity (capture the flag) challenges.
EnIGMA achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks (see [leaderboard](https://enigma-agent.com/#results)).
The EnIGMA project introduced multiple features that are available in all modes of SWE-agent, such as the [debugger and server connection tools](https://swe-agent.com/0.7/background/iat/) and a [summarizer](https://swe-agent.com/0.7/config/summarizers/) to handle long outputs.
