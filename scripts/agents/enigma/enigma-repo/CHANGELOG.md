## 0.5.0 (2024-05-28)

[All new commits](https://github.com/swe-agent/SWE-agent/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0)

âœ¨ The big news is our [brand new documentation](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/SWE-agent/) âœ¨

Secondly, @ollmer added a new flag `--cache_task_images` that will significantly speed up SWE-agent when running on the same environment/repository multiple times (no more waiting for cloning and installation!)

### Breaking changes

* We have reformatted our codebase. If you create a PR based on a previous commit, make sure you install our `pre-commit` hook to avoid merge-conflicts because of formatting. See [our docs](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/SWE-agent/dev/formatting_conflicts/) for more information.
